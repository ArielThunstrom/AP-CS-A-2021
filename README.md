Projects from AP Computer Science A: Java
## Hangman
* One of the projects I was given was to create a hangman game and add my own plus one. For this project, I learned how to compare strings and return the similarities. In addition to creating the basic game, I made different levels of difficulty. Upon start up, the program will prompt the user to choses a difficulty. If the user types "hard" for example, the word they must guess will have more letters and less guesses compared to if the user were to type "easy".
## Palindrama

## Hawaiian Words
* Hawaiian Words will take in a word from the user and first determine if the word is hawaiin and then it will return the hawaiian pronunciation of that word. My biggest challenge with this project was figuring out how to determine the vowel groupings.
