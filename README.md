Projects from AP Computer Science A: Java
## Hangman
* One of the projects I was given was to create a hangman game and add my own plus one. For this project, I learned how to compare strings and return the similarities. In addition to creating the basic game, I made different levels of difficulty. Upon start up, the program will prompt the user to choses a difficulty. If the user types "hard" for example, the word they must guess will have more letters and less guesses compared to if the user were to type "easy".
## Palindrama
* For this project, the goal was to find the largest palindome within a string. First, had to create a method that found palindomes. This method was very difficult to write because I had to compare the char and the begining of the string and the char at the end of the string without getting an index out of bounds. I completed this project with a partner, and I found that breaking up the projects into small methods made it ot only easier to debug, but also easier to distrubute the work with my partner. 
## Hawaiian Words
* Hawaiian Words will take in a word from the user and first determine if the word is hawaiin and then it will return the hawaiian pronunciation of that word. My biggest challenge with this project was figuring out how to determine the vowel groupings. After checking for volwel groupings, I used an array list to store the letters/groupings and then translated each element in the array list to the hawaiian counterpart.
